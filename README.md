# Pandas Data Handling
This Python project demonstrates the basic usage of the pandas library for data manipulation. 
It includes examples of creating 1-dimensional Series, combining them into a 2-dimensional DataFrame, and reading/writing CSV files.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the pandas library if not already installed using the command `pip install pandas` in command prompt
3. Navigate to the directory containing the Python file (main.py).
4. Run the program using a Python interpreter
5. The program will execute and display the created Series, DataFrame, and CSV data.
